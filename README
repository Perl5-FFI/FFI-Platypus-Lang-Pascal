NAME

    FFI::Platypus::Lang::Pascal - Documentation and tools for using
    Platypus with the Free Pascal programming language

SYNOPSIS

    # TODO

DESCRIPTION

    This modules provides native types and demangling for the Free Pascal
    Programming language when used with FFI::Platypus.

CAVEATS

    I've been experimenting with Free Pascal 2.6.0 while working on this
    module.

    TODO

METHODS

    Generally you will not use this class directly, instead interacting
    with the FFI::Platypus instance. However, the public methods used by
    Platypus are documented here.

 native_type_map

     my $hashref = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Pascal->native_type_map;

    This returns a hash reference containing the native aliases for the
    Free Pascal programming languages. That is the keys are native C++
    types and the values are libffi native types.

    Types are in camel case. For example use ShortInt, not Shortint or
    SHORTINT.

 mangler

     my $mangler = FFI::Platypus::Lang::Pascal->mangler($ffi->libs);
     # prints ADD_ADD$SMALLINT$SMALLINT$$SMALLINT
     print $mangler->("add(smallint,smallint):smallint");

    Returns a subroutine reference that will "mangle" C++ names.

EXAMPLES

    See the above "SYNOPSIS" or the examples directory that came with this
    distribution.
